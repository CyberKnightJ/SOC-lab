# SOC Lab

## Objective
The objective of this lab is to provide hands-on, real-world SOC analyst experience, focusing on developing, practicing, and refining essential cybersecurity skills. The lab involves monitoring, detection, analysis, and response to simulated cybersecurity threats, building readiness to handle a variety of real-world security incidents effectively.

### Skills learned
- Designing Logical Diagrams: Creating clear, effective diagrams to represent network architecture and data flows in a SOC environment.
- Cloud Server Deployment: Setting up and configuring servers in a cloud environment to support SOC operations and simulations.
- SIEM Configuration and Management: Installing, configuring, and managing a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system to centralize and analyze security logs.
- Firewall Configuration: Setting up and managing firewalls to control network traffic and implement security policies.
- Cyber Attack Simulation, Detection, and Investigation: Simulating cyber attacks and developing skills to detect, investigate, and respond effectively.
- Alert and Dashboard Creation: Configuring alerts for key security events and building dashboards to visualize and track SOC metrics and incidents.
- Ticketing System Integration: Setting up and integrating a ticketing system for efficient incident tracking, documentation, and resolution management.
  
### Tools used
- Vultr Cloud Service: Used to deploy cloud-based servers and infrastructure for SOC lab exercises.
- Microsoft Defender: Employed for endpoint detection and response, helping identify and mitigate threats at the device level.
- PowerShell: Used for scripting and automation tasks in Windows environments, streamlining configurations and SOC workflows.
- ELK Stack (SIEM): Leveraging Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana for SIEM functionalities, including log management, search, and visualization.
- Mythic: A red team command-and-control (C2) framework used for simulating and managing adversarial tactics in a controlled environment.
